              Egg donation involves ovarian stimulation to produce multiple eggs, followed by a minor procedure to retrieve them.

              Embryo donation allows individuals or couples with surplus embryos to help others facing infertility challenges. These embryos
              are often created during IVF treatment and stored for future use.
